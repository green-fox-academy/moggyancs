# Create a function that prints the multiplication table of a given base number.
# It should take the base number as a parameter, and prints the output to the
# console.

# The output should look like this for 5 as base:
#  1 * 5 = 5
#  2 * 5 = 10
#  3 * 5 = 15
#  4 * 5 = 20
#  5 * 5 = 25
#  6 * 5 = 30
#  7 * 5 = 35
#  8 * 5 = 40
#  9 * 5 = 45
#  10 * 5 = 50
