# The crash-incidents.csv file contains data of road crash-incidents.
# (id; location; surface type; surface condition; light condition; weather condition; crash date; year)
# Your task will be to count how many crash-incidents happened at good/bad
# weather conditions.
# Good weather conditions are CLOUDY and CLEAR.
# Bad weather conditions are RAIN, FREEZING RAIN, SNOW, FOG and SEVERE CROSSWINDS.
# So create the necessary method(s) that returns with the amount of crash-incidents.
# And print the return value to the console:
# The amount of crashes at good weather conditions: {amount}
# The amount of crashes at bad weather conditions: {amount}
